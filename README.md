# Serenity (working title)

Inspired by the [Momentum Dash](https://momentumdash.com/) extension for Chrome.

The goal of Serenity is to create something that&apos;s similar to the extension, but more customizable, works in multiple browsers and is modifiable by the user.

## Usage

- Clone/fork the repository
- Install the modules (`pnpm install`)
- Get a key from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com)
- In the backend directory, copy the `env.local.sample` to `.env.local` and enter the relevant values (and update the UNSPLASH_COLLECTION_IDS if wanted)
- Run `pnpm start`

## Goals

- Make it customizable
    - Configurable collections per user/client
- More apps
- Synchronized configuration

> Note: This is a work in progress
